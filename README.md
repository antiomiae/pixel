## Dependencies
### macOS
```brew install cmake```

## Building
From the project directory, run:
```
git submodule init
./init && ./build
```
This will take a while to build all the dependencies. And I'm sorry for that, but I don't know what I'm doing.
To run any program from the demos folder, use the run script:
```./run particles```
